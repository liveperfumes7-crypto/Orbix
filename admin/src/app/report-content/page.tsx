        <p>The fastest way: open the post in Orbix, tap <b>⋮ → Report</b> and choose a reason (sexual or nude, violence, hate or harassment, copyright, spam or scam, other). You can also block a channel from the same menu.</p>
        <p>Reports are reviewed by our team, and content that breaks our <a href="/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> is hidden.</p>
        <h2>Cannot use the app?</h2>
        <p>Email <a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a> with the link to the post or channel, the reason, and (for copyright) your name and proof that you own the work.</p>
        <h2>Need help with something else?</h2>
        <p>Write to the same address with your account email and, for payments, your order reference (it starts with OB).</p>
